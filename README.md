# Main Scope of the Project

The owner of an independent game shop wants to expand their business with an online store. Our task is to develop a web application that allows the owner and employees to manage the product catalog, inventory, and customer orders. The system should also provide a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase games online. 

Key functionalities include:
- Store staff can manage the inventory, add new games, and remove games.
- The owner can approve new games before they are published.
- Customers can create accounts, purchase games, track order history, save items to a wish list, and post reviews.
- The owner requires an administrative dashboard for managing employees, game categories, reviewing customer orders, and replying to reviews.

The application must support these functionalities via a web frontend, ensuring accessibility for all stakeholders. No external system integrations are required. 

## DELIVERABLES:

# Deliverable 1: Requirements, Domain Model, and Database Design

You can see the Deliverable Report here: [Deliverable1](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2024/project-group-11/wiki/Deliverable1)


This deliverable includes:
- requirements selection (functional and non-functional system requirements).
- Use case diagrams and detailed specifications for six use cases.
- A domain model represented through UML class diagrams.
- A PostgreSQL-based persistence layer implemented.
- A test suite validating read/write operations for each class of the domain model.
- A build system automating the compilation and testing processes.
- Documentation of team meetings and design decisions in the project wiki.
